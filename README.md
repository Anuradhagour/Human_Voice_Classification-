# Human_Voice_Classification-
Develop a machine learning-based model to classify and cluster human voice samples.  The system will preprocess the dataset, apply clustering and classification models, and evaluate their performance. The final application will provide an interface for uploading audio samples and receiving predictions, deployed via Streamlit.
#  Business Use Cases
  1.Speaker Identification:
      Identify individuals based on their voice features.
  2.Gender Classification:
      Classify voices as male or female for various applications like call center analytics.
  3.Speech Analytics:
      Extract insights from audio data for industries such as media, security, and customer service.
  4.Assistive Technologies:
      Improve accessibility solutions by analyzing voice patterns.
